# Data API


The purpose of this repository is the construction, implementation and consumption of Data API for Machine Learning. I'm using the pre-trained Hunggind face Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT) model, fine-tuned on VQAv2

## Intended uses & limitations
You can use the raw model for visual question answering.
